# Microprocessor
this project was built using Proteus (PDSPRJ ) file , so Proteus is needed to run it.

design and implement a microprocessor-based system containing four RAM chips (divided between two banks)
connected to an 8086 microprocessor, then write assembly code to test the accessibility
of the first byte, first two bytes, last byte and last two bytes of each of the chips.
